    <b>"Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro"</b> is a classic animated film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, originally released in 1979. It is the second feature film in the Lupin III franchise, which originated from the manga series created by Monkey Punch.
    The movie follows the exploits of the charismatic and roguish master thief, Lupin III, and his partner Jigen as they embark on a daring adventure to uncover the secrets of a counterfeit money operation in the small European country of Cagliostro.
</p>

<p>
    The original theatrical release in Japan occurred on <b>15 December 1979</b>, distributed by Toho. In North America, it was screened at various festivals in the early 1980s, while a heavily edited and shortened version became available in the form of an arcade LaserDisc video game, Cliff Hanger (1983), combined with footage from the previous Lupin III film, The Mystery of Mamo (1978). The Castle of Cagliostro eventually made its American theatrical debut on 3 April 1991, with the home release following in October 1992.
</p>
<p>
    This first theatrical dub was produced by Streamline Pictures and released on home video the following year.
    A new dubbed version was produced by Manga Entertainment in 2000 and has had several releases.
    Despite initially underperforming at the box office, The Castle of Cagliostro has garnered <b>high praise</b>, with critics and historians noting the film's influence on Miyazaki's later works, becoming the most popular and well-regarded entry in the entire Lupin III franchise, and has since been recognised as a cult film.
    However, some have disapproved of its depiction of Lupin as a gallant hero instead of his original persona as a ruthless criminal. The film has served as a major influence on animators and directors worldwide, such as Pixar director John Lasseter and several Disney films, including titles of the Disney Renaissance.
    The Japanese computer animated film Lupin III: The First (2019) also has a plot structure loosely modelled after The Castle of Cagliostro.
